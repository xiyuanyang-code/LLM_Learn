# Learn LLMs from scratch

## Introduction

I hope to continuously add learning code about the foundational knowledge of LLMs, such as Transformers, in this repository, aiming to become a proficient LLM developer and enhance my engineering skills in developing LLMs beyond just API calls.

## Todo List

- Torch Memo

  - Basic Commands of Torch (In another repo, to be merged in the future)

- Transformer Basic Principles

  - To be done in the Blog first

- `Learning Transformer from scratch`

  - This is on Y2b.

- `Learning RAG from scratch`

  - This is on Y2b too.

## Never Stop Coding

Never stop coding!
