    "\n",
    "> \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\" (J. R. Firth 1957)\n",
    "\n",
    "This quote is a summary of distributional semantics, and motivated word2vec.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word2Vec** is a popular technique for learning **word embeddings**. Developed by Tomas Mikolov and his team at Google, it is a quintessential model of the **distributional semantics** paradigm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Word2Vec is to transform words from a discrete, high-dimensional **one-hot encoding** representation into a **continuous, low-dimensional, and dense vector** format. These vectors are designed to capture the **semantic and syntactic relationships** between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in a well-trained Word2Vec model, we can perform vector arithmetic like:\n",
    "$$\\text{vec}(\\text{king}) - \\text{vec}(\\text{man}) + \\text{vec}(\\text{woman}) \\approx \\text{vec}(\\text{queen})$$\n",
    "This demonstrates that the model has successfully learned the semantic relationship of \"gender.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec consists of two main model architectures: **CBOW** and **Skip-gram**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words) Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The training objective of the CBOW model is to **predict a target word from its surrounding context words**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **How it works**:\n",
    "    -   The model operates within a sliding window. For example, with a window size of 2, for the sentence `the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`, the context words for the target word `fox` would be `the`, `quick`, `jumps`, `over`.\n",
    "    -   CBOW takes the vectors of these context words (which are randomly initialized at the start of training), averages or sums them to get a single context vector.\n",
    "    -   This context vector is then used as input to a simple neural network to predict the target word `fox`.\n",
    "    -   The training process involves continuously adjusting the word vectors to maximize the accuracy of predicting the target word.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Skip-gram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Skip-gram model's training objective is the opposite of CBOW: it **predicts the context words from a target word**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **How it works**:\n",
    "    -   Again, it operates within a sliding window. With `fox` as the target word, it attempts to predict each of the context words in the window: `the`, `quick`, `jumps`, `over`.\n",
    "    -   The model takes the vector of the target word `fox` as input and uses a neural network to calculate the probability of each context word appearing.\n",
    "    -   The training process adjusts the word vectors to **maximize the probability of predicting each of the context words**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Advantages**:\n",
    "    -   It works better on large datasets.\n",
    "    -   It is particularly good at handling **rare words**, as each rare word is used as a target word multiple times to predict its context, leading to more accurate representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Process and Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "The Word2Vec model is essentially a **shallow neural network**. It has no hidden layer, and the word vectors are learned as the weights of the network. To handle the immense size of typical vocabularies, the standard Softmax layer would be computationally prohibitive. Thus, Word2Vec introduced two powerful optimization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Negative Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Problem**: The Softmax function's computation scales linearly with the vocabulary size. With millions of words, computing and updating the Softmax probabilities for all words during each training step is extremely slow.\n",
    "-   **Solution**: Negative sampling transforms a large multiclass classification problem (predicting the correct word) into a simpler **binary classification problem**.\n",
    "-   **How it works**:\n",
    "    -   For a given training sample (e.g., target word `fox`, context word `quick`), we treat it as a **positive sample**.\n",
    "    -   Simultaneously, we **randomly sample a few unrelated words** from the vocabulary (e.g., `cat`, `tree`, `table`) and designate them as **negative samples**.\n",
    "    -   The model's objective becomes:\n",
    "        -   Maximize the similarity of the positive pair (`fox`, `quick`).\n",
    "        -   Minimize the similarity of the negative pairs (`fox`, `cat`), (`fox`, `tree`), etc.\n",
    "-   **Effect**: This dramatically reduces the number of parameters that need to be updated in each iteration, significantly speeding up training.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hierarchical Softmax\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **An alternative optimization method**: It structures the vocabulary into a **Huffman Tree**.\n",
    "-   **Effect**: This reduces the computational complexity of the Softmax layer from $O(V)$ (where V is the vocabulary size) to $O(\\log_2 V)$, accelerating training.\n",
    "\n",

    "    -   Note that the target sequence also starts with a sentinel token and ends with a sentinel token that does not correspond to any corrupted span, which helps the model know when to stop generating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Span Corruption **explicitly** trains the model to generate **sequences of text**, not just isolated tokens. This makes the model more proficient at **generative tasks** such as summarization, question answering, and machine translation, as these tasks inherently involve generating a text sequence."
