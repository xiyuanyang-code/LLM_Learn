# Transformer Training Project

This project implements a small Transformer model for training on a publicly available dataset. The goal is to demonstrate the capabilities of Transformer architectures in handling various tasks such as text classification, translation, or other sequence-based tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the Transformer model can be found in the `data` directory. Please refer to the `data/README.md` file for detailed information on how to access and preprocess the data.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd transformer-training-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

After training, you can evaluate the model using:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```
