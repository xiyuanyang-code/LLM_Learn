# Dataset Information for Transformer Training

This README file provides information about the dataset used for training the Transformer model in this project.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used for training the Transformer model is a publicly available dataset that can be accessed from [insert dataset source link here]. It contains [brief description of the dataset, e.g., text data, images, etc.], which is suitable for [mention the task, e.g., language translation, text classification, etc.].

## Accessing the Dataset

To access the dataset, you can download it from the provided link. Once downloaded, place the dataset files in the `data/` directory of this project.

## Preprocessing the Data

Before training the model, the data needs to be preprocessed. The preprocessing steps include:

1. **Loading the Data**: Use the `DataLoader` class from `src/data_loader.py` to load the dataset.
2. **Cleaning the Data**: Remove any unnecessary characters or noise from the dataset.
3. **Tokenization**: Convert the text data into tokens that can be fed into the Transformer model.
4. **Padding**: Ensure that all sequences are of the same length by padding shorter sequences.
5. **Splitting the Data**: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

Refer to the `src/data_loader.py` file for detailed methods on how to load and preprocess the data.

## Example Usage

To load and preprocess the dataset, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
from src.data_loader import DataLoader

data_loader = DataLoader()
train_data, val_data, test_data = data_loader.load_data('path/to/dataset')
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/dataset'` with the actual path to your dataset files.

## Conclusion

This dataset is crucial for training the Transformer model effectively. Ensure that you follow the preprocessing steps to prepare the data for optimal performance during training.
